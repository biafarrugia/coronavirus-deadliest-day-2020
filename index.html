     <p> On 11th January 2020, China announced that a 61-year-old man from Wuhan had died from a mysterious viral pneumonia. He was the first victim of COVID-19.
 </p>

  <p> Exactly 353 days later, the world recorded the deadliest day of the pandemic. </p>

<p> Using data* from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Johns Hopkins University (JHU), this website tells the story of the coronavirus deadliest day in 2020.

     <h2 class="content-subhead"> The year </h2> 
  
 <p> The coronavirus pandemic killed 1.8 million people across the world in 2020, between 11th January, when the first death was confirmed, and 31st December.
  </p>
      
      <p> The following video represents the daily number of coronavirus deaths registered by Johns Hopkins University.</p>
      
      <p>The double bass tones are equivalent to the deaths per day, while the glockenspiel sounds mark the time passing.
 </p>
      
      <p>The ambient sound is a human breathing, part of the respiratory system, which is attacked by the SARS-Cov-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. 
 </p>      
          
      <p>Every time the coronavirus deaths reach at least six thousand, you are going to hear a mandolin sound. </p>

 <h2 class="content-subhead"> The day </h2> 
      <p> The coronavirus pandemic reached its deadliest day on 29th December, when 15,512 deaths were confirmed across the world, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University.
</p>

<p> The deaths occurred in 122 territories of 120 countries because Mayotte, an archipelago in the Indian Ocean that belongs to France, and Hong Kong, a Chinese autonomous province, counted victims that day. </p>

<p> Considering the countries recognized by the United Nations (UN), lives were lost in 61% of the world on 29th December 2020.  </p>

  <div class="fold3"> 
       <p> The number is close to the 15,899 deaths recorded on the 11th March 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan. The catastrophe was one of the most powerful earthquakes in the last century.
 </p>
       
       <p> And it is five times higher than the 9/11, when Al-Qaeda launched coordinated terrorist attacks against the United States. </p>
       
       <p> On average, the SARS-Cov-2 virus killed 10.7 people per minute on 29th December 2020. </p>

     <p> One of them was the U.S. Congressman-elect <b>Luke Letlow</b>, 41. The Republican from Louisiana died 11 days after testing positive for coronavirus.

  <br>
   <p> He was admitted to St. Francis Medical Center on 19th December. When his condition worsed, he was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Ochsner LSU Health Shreveport.
 </p>
  
   <p> The congressman suffered a heart attack after a surgical operation to remove a blood clot and died on 29th December, five days before he would be sworn into office. </p>
<p> Mr. Letlow was elected to Congress early in December to represent Louisiana's 5th District.  </p>

 <p>The hospital reported that he had no underlying health conditions. </p>
  
   <p>The congressman left behind a wife, Julia Barnhill Letlow, and two young children, Jeremiah, 3, and Jacqueline, 11 months. </p>

<h2 class="content-subhead"> The places </h2> 
  <p> Luke Letlow died in the US, the country that recorded the highest number of victims on 29th December.  
</p> 
<br><div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/4899037"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
  <br>
<p> <b>Dr. Marco Aurélio Safadi</b>, infectologist at Sabará Hospital, said that the absence of a universal public health service, the lack of coordinated actions and how President Donald Trump managed the crisis have contributed to the country lead the ranking of coronavirus victims.
  
<p> “Political authorities' speeches and the president himself made it difficult to fight the pandemic. There were misinformation about social isolation and masks, as well as the promotion of drugs without scientific basis”, said Mr. Safadi, adding  that Brazil has also been experiencing a similar situation.  </p> 

<p> However, adjusting the deaths for population size, the hardest hit countries on 29th December are Europeans.
</p>
<br>
  <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/4937678"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
  <br> 
<p> The continent entered a second wave of the pandemic in November, when a new COVID-19 variant, the B.1.1.7 lineage, was discovered in the UK. 
 </p>

 <p> “We still do not know whether the high number of deaths is an effect of the new variant, or whether it reflects the behavior of people, who are already exhausted from following social isolation, or even whether it is a combination of the two factors," said Mr. Safadi. </p>

 <div class="fold5"> 
<br>
<p> Europe and America accumulated 88% of the total coronavirus deaths on 29th December, despite the fact that the most populous countries in the world, China and India, are in Asia.
 </p>

<p> “In December, after a period of stabilization, Europe started to record more cases and deaths.These numbers were added to those registered in the United States and Brazil, which have not yet left the first wave”, said <b>Dr. Raquel Stucchi</b>, an infectologist at Unicamp and consultant to the Brazilian Society of Infectious Diseases.
 </p>
  
  <p> But the expert highlighted that it is impossible to know the exact dimension of the pandemic in terms of deaths and geolocation, as each country has its own methodology to confirm the cases. </p>
<br>
  <br> </div>
<div class="fold6"> 
<p> <h2 class="content-subhead"> The month </h2> </p>
<p>Contrary to expectations that the worst moment of the pandemic had passed, December was the coronavirus deadliest month across the world. 
 </p>

<p> “I don't expect the virus will disappear. Actually, it has mutated to spread faster. At this point, all efforts around the world should be to vaccinate people”, said Ms. Stucchi.  </p>

<p> <b>Sabila Khan</b> followed the escalation in the number of deaths over the year. 
 </p>

<p>The young woman from New Jersey lost her father, Shafqat Khan, 76, during the first wave of the pandemic, on 14th April. </p>

  <br>
  
   <p>Three days later, Sabila created a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/covidlosssupport"> support group on Facebook </a> for those who have experienced similar trauma. Today, more than five thousand people share their grief in the virtual space. </p>
   
   <p>“It was really traumatic because we couldn't be with him. We couldn't have a proper funeral for him. We had to watch it live streamed on our phones”, she said.
 </p>
   
   <p>“I read a statistic somewhere that behind every ‘covided’ there are nine family members and close friends who are left behind. So there is an enormous wave of grief and trauma”.</p>
   
   <p><b>Nancy Abramson</b> is one of the group members. She lost her father, Paul Abramson, on 23rd April, also in New Jersey, after four weeks fighting the virus.
 </p>
   
    <p>“He was 92 years old, but very vital. I mean, he's still interacted with everybody, he had parties, he was ready to go out, he bet on sports, he facetimed, he still went out to dinner. He still had way more life to live”, disse Ms Abramson.

   “I feel very angry and I feel very sad simultaneously being on this. It is just incredulous that there are more people continuing to join a support group with the same kind of stories. It is really upsetting to be reading on how people are still experiencing this nine months later”.
  
    <p>For <b>Gustavo Zucchi</b>, who lost his grandmother Aparecida Pivotto Zuchi, 90, on 19th May in Brazil, “people have become accustomed to the number of deaths” and fail to realize the scale of the tragedy. 

 </p>
   
    <p>“In a while, we will see the size of this tragedy. How many people died, how many celebrities and personalities died, how many friends will no longer be here”, he said.

 If the world held a minute's silence for each person who died of coronavirus on 29th December, it would have 10 muted days. 

 </p>

    <p> For the 1.8 million deaths recorded in 2020, it would be three years and four months in silence. </p>
